# Publish @stonedogcode/tests to npm, end to end.
#
#   npm run publish:stonedog-tests
#
# Run it from a terminal, INTERACTIVELY. npm prompts for the 2FA one-time
# password itself (account `stonedogcode`) and the login flow needs a browser —
# neither works unattended, which is why this is a script a person runs rather
# than a step in CI. An agent cannot complete it.
#
# You do NOT need to log in first. If `npm whoami` comes back empty the script
# starts `npm login` for you and carries on, the way the sibling packages'
# scripts do. Refusing there — as this script briefly did — only makes the
# operator run the whole preflight a second time for no reason.
#
# It keeps the lesson the sibling packages' scripts were built on: a publish that
# prints no error can still have published nothing, or the wrong thing. So it
# reads the tarball before publishing and installs from the REGISTRY afterwards,
# because "the registry lists it" and "a consumer can install it" are different
# claims and the second is the last to start answering yes.
#
# ## Traps specific to this package
#
# 1. It ships TypeScript SOURCE under `src/`, and consumers add
#    `node_modules/@stonedogcode/tests/src/**` to their Panda `include` globs.
#    Anything shipped under src/ is statically parsed at the CONSUMER's build,
#    so a stray test file is parsed by every consumer and imports jest globals
#    that are not dependencies. `verify:package` refuses such a tarball.
#
# 2. THREE entry points (`.`, `./node`, `./styled`). A tarball missing any one
#    installs fine and fails at the consumer's first import.
#
# 3. `react`/`react-dom` are peers ONLY. Listed as dependencies too, npm
#    installs a second React into the package, and two Reacts in one tree fail
#    with "Invalid hook call" — pointing at the consumer's component rather than
#    at this manifest.
#
# 4. The scope. A scoped package defaults to `access: restricted` on npm;
#    publishing one without `publishConfig.access: public` succeeds, prints
#    nothing unusual, and then 404s for every consumer — which reads as a
#    missing package rather than as a private one.
#
# 5. `engines` is `>=22`, above the fleet's usual 20, because the collector
#    globs with `fs.promises.glob`. Do not "fix" it downward.
